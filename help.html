   > The game will display a blank field with five dashes representing the five letters of the unknown word.
<br><br>
   > You have six attempts to guess the unknown word. Click or tap on the letters to guess the word.
<br><br>
> If a letter is correct and in the correct position, it will be displayed in green. If a letter is correct but in the wrong position, it will be displayed in yellow.
<br><br>
> If a letter is not in the word, it will be displayed in gray.
<br><br>
> Use the feedback from each guess to narrow down the possibilities of the word.
<br><br>
> Keep guessing until you have correctly guessed the word, or until you have used up all six attempts.
