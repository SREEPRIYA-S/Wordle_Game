This is a web-based implementation of the popular word-guessing game Wordle. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is designed to provide an enjoyable and challenging experience.
# How to play
The game selects a secret word, which the player must guess.
The player enters a word into the input field and clicks the "Guess" button.
The game provides feedback on the correctness of the word. A letter in the word will be highlighted green if it is in the correct position, yellow if it is in the word but in a different position, and gray if it is not in the word.
The player has six chances to guess the word correctly. If the player is unable to guess the word in six attempts, the game is over.
